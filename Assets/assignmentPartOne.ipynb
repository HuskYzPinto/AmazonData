    "# Part 1.1: Describe the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "#     The product category I selected is the Video Games category, with two variations of the datasets included: 5-Core reviews dataset and all reviews dataset. The 5-Core dataset contains only reviews from users and products with at least five reviews, while all reviews dataset contain every review entry, subsequently making it much more diverse. There are a total of 1324753 reviews; however, the 5-Core dataset only contains 231780 reviews. There is also a file for metadata dataset; however, that is a completely different set of information rather than a variation. Metadata contains information regarding each product. Only the 5-Core reviews dataset will be used in this analysis. This is because video games is a highly competitive market with multiple online stores available. Amazon does not have its own social platform for gaming (unlike Steam, Origin or Epic Store), making it less popular in general. However, a lot of people buy video games from Amazon when sales are happening. These customers are however unlikely to leave a review on Amazon. Nevertheless, if a user provides multiple reviews on Amazon, it is more likely that they use Amazon to buy video games in general. Therefore, I assume that their reviews should be more reliable than one-off customers. Likewise, as for video games, a lot of games are based on different platforms and people usually buy the games on their respective platforms. This means that there are much fewer copies being sold on Amazon. Products with less than five reviews are likely to have a very small share in the market and do not reflect the trend within the category.\n",
    "\n",
    "#     The reviews and metadata can be linked together using the Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN) unique to each product. Both variations of the reviews dataset contains reviewerID and asin as the identifier, with other attributes being reviewerName, helpful, reviewText, overall, summary, unixReviewTime, and reviewTime. The metadata uses asin as the identifier and contains description, price, imURL, related, salesRank, categories, title, and brand. The attributes I will be using from the product data are the asin, description, price, related, salesRank, title and brand, while every attribute of the review data will be used in this analysis. Only video games product will be included in the analysis, meaning that electronics and gaming equipment will be filtered out for this report."

    "# I use the code provided at the source of the dataset to extract DataFrames from the downloaded files, then save each of them into Apache Parquet files using the df.to_parquet function in pandas. The detailed implementation of this can be found in the code written later in this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "# As for normalisation, the category data is split into multiple columns with a boolean representing each value instead of being contained in a single object. Similarly, the salesRank data will also be unwrapped from the dictionary object into a number. The brand and title of each item will also be removed as most of them do not have a value and will not contribute to the analysis. Since this analysis is focused on video games category, only the video games sales rank will be retained. Helpful column in reviews data will also be split into upvotes and downvotes. Moreover, related items will be removed from the metadata as we are not analysing the relationship between each item. UnixReviewTime will also be excluded as users are from different parts of the world; therefore they are from different timezones and it wll be hard to determine the relationship between time of the day and the reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# For the metadata, items without a price is excluded as they tend to be some uncommon product people sell on the store. To clarify, standard products on Amazon should have their price listed, and the ones without are those sold by users. As a result, they are too inconsistent and unreliable for the analysis. Moreover, the metadata for the products not mentioned by the reviews in the 5-Core dataframe will also be filtered out of the analysis. ImageUrl will also be removed as the column is not required for the analysis. Reviewer Names will be excluded from the analysis as reviewerID will be used to identify each reviewer instead. Console games will be excluded as the market's growth and evolution is completely different from that of PC games."

Additionally, sales number should also increase greatly during seasonal sales; this should be reflected in the number of reviews over specific periods."
