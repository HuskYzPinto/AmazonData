    "### Part 1.1: Describe the dataset\n",
    "# The product category I selected is the Video Games category, with two variations of the datasets included: 5-Core reviews dataset and all reviews dataset. The 5-Core dataset contains only reviews from users and products with at least five reviews, while all reviews dataset contain every review entry, subsequently making it much more diverse. There are a total of 1324753 reviews; however, the 5-Core dataset only contains 231780 reviews. There is also a file for metadata dataset; however, that is a completely different set of information rather than a variation. Metadata contains information regarding each product. Only the 5-Core reviews dataset will be used in this analysis. This is because video games is a highly competitive market with multiple online stores available. Amazon does not have its own social platform for gaming (unlike Steam, Origin or Epic Store), making it less popular in general. However, a lot of people buy video games from Amazon when sales are happening. These customers are however unlikely to leave a review on Amazon. Nevertheless, if a user provides multiple reviews on Amazon, it is more likely that they use Amazon to buy video games in general. Therefore, I assume that their reviews will generally be more reliable than one-off customers. Likewise, as for video games, a lot of games are based on different platforms and people usually buy the games on their respective platforms. This means that there are much fewer copies being sold on Amazon. Products with less than five reviews are likely to have a very small share in the market and do not reflect the trend within the category.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The reviews and metadata can be linked together using the Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN) unique to each product. \n",
    "# Both variations of the reviews dataset contains reviewerID and asin as the identifier, with other attributes being reviewerName, helpful, reviewText, overall, summary, unixReviewTime, and reviewTime. The metadata uses asin as the identifier and contains description, price, imURL, related, salesRank, categories, title, and brand. The attributes I will be using from the product data are the asin, description, price, related, salesRank, title and brand, while every attribute of the review data will be used in this analysis. Only video games product will be included in the analysis, meaning that electronics and gaming equipment will be filtered out for this report."
